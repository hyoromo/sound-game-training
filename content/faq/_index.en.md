{{%expand "Q. When will the \"xxx\" app type be added?" %}}
It is difficult to support the recent iOS devices due to the increase in the number of different ratios. In addition, there are more and more apps that allow you to adjust the touchline position on the sound game app side, so it is not worth it.<br>This is why the frequency of updating the app types is low. However, that doesn't mean we don't want to increase the frequency.

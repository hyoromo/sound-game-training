You can set up the touch sound in \"Settings  Settings on Video  Sound\" in the app.\nThere are different types of touch sounds, so you can choose the one you like best â™ª~        Q. Can I see the touch points?   You can adjust the display settings for touch from \"Settings  Settings on Video  Point\" in the application.\nYou can also customize the color and size of the display to make it your own. â™ª~        Q. Can I adjust the volume of the touch tone?   You cannot do this in the app. Please adjust the volume on your device.        Q. The home bar gets in the way during pseudo-play, making it difficult to play. Is there a home bar setting?   You can ignore the first Home Bar operation by going to \"Settings  Video  Home Bar\" in the application.        Q. I\u0026#39;m having trouble with the tap position and the pause button being in the same place in some playback videos. Can you fix this?   You can change the pause button to a long tap.\nOn the \"Folder List\" screen, you can select \"Edit  Settings on Video  Pause button\" to switch to long tap.        Q. Where can I set up the touchscreen display in the application?   On the \"Folder List\" screen, you can set it up by going to \"Edit  Select Folder  App Type\".        Q. Can you fix the sound shift?   There is no way to solve this problem within the application, but I hope to address it someday.        Q. Is there a way to fast-forward or rewind a few seconds?   You can set it using the \"Folder Settings  Fast forward/rewind button\" button at the bottom left of the folder/video list screen.\nYou can also adjust the position of the display on the video screen and the number of seconds â™ª~        Q.

The default setting is 360p.\nYou can configure the settings from \"Common Settings  Video traffic\" at the bottom left of the video list screen.       Q. When will the \u0026#34;xxx\u0026#34; application type be added?   It is difficult to support the recent iOS devices due to the increase in the number of different ratios. In addition, there are more and more apps that allow you to adjust the touchline position on the sound game app side, so it is not worth it.\nThis is why the frequency of updating the app types is low. However, that doesn't mean we don't want to increase the frequency.     Requests/bugs    Q. Where do I submit my request?   Please send us your request from \"Contact\" in the app. We can't accept all requests, but we will consider them.\nI'm also open to reviews on the AppStore. However, it is difficult to communicate with them, so we may not be able to understand their intentions.        Q. Where do I report bugs?   Please send us your request from the \"Contact\" section of the app. Since it is difficult to communicate with AppStore reviews, it may not be possible to reproduce them and there may be a delay in responding.        Q. YouTube videos no longer play in the app. Is this a bug?   It's most likely a bug. Please contact us from the \"Contact\" section of the app, including the URL of the video that is not playing.        Q. Videos from my camera roll no longer play in the app. Is this a bug?   Deleting a video from the camera roll will stop it from playing.\nIf you choose to save photos to iCloud, they will not be playable at a later date. Please register the video uploaded to iCloud to the application.\nIf you have videos in your camera roll but they do not play, try restarting the app/device to see if that solves the problem.       Q. The video position appears in a strange place on the video screen. Can this be fixed?   After clicking \"Play  Stop\" on the video screen, touch the \"grid icon\" in the lower left corner of the screen and swipe the screen to move the position.     Other    Q. Can\u0026#39;t I get rid of ads through in-app purchases?   You can turn them off by joining as a supporter.\nFor details, please tap the \"Hide Ads\" button at the bottom of the video list screen.        Q. Do you accept donations?   I accept from the Tip link in the top left menu.       Q. Will you be distributing the Android app?   Distribution started on 08/06/2022.\nFor the Android version, please refer to the following website.\nhttps://hyoromo.github.io/sound-game-training-android/\n    "

Can I adjust the volume of the touch sound?   You cannot do this in the app. Please adjust the volume on your device.        Q. The home bar gets in the way during pseudo-play, making it difficult to play. Is there a home bar setting?   You can ignore the first home bar operation from \"Settings  Video  Home Bar\" in the app.        Q. I\u0026#39;m having trouble with the tap position and pause button being in the same place in some play videos. Can you fix this problem?   You can change the pause button to a long tap.\nOn the \"Folder List\" screen, you can select \"Edit  Settings on Video  Pause button\" to change to long tap.        Q. Where can I set up the app\u0026#39;s touchline display?   On the \"Folder List\" screen, you can set it up by going to \"Edit  Select Folder  App Type\".        Q. Can you fix the sound shift?   There is no way to solve this problem within the app.\nI do hope to respond to this someday, though.        Q. Is there a function to fast forward/rewind for a few seconds?   You can set it from the \"Folder Settings  Fast forward/rewind button\" button at the bottom left of the folder/video list screen.\nYou can also adjust the position of the display on the video screen and the number of seconds ‚ô™~        Q.

The default setting is 360p.\nYou can configure the settings from \"Common Settings  Video traffic\" at the bottom left of the video list screen.       Q. When will the \u0026#34;xxx\u0026#34; app type be added?   It is difficult to support the recent iOS devices due to the increase in the number of different ratios. In addition, there are more and more apps that allow you to adjust the touchline position on the sound game app side, so it is not worth it.\nThis is why the frequency of updating the app types is low. However, that doesn't mean we don't want to increase the frequency.     Requests/bugs    Q. Where do I make my request?   Please send us your request from \"Contact\" in the app. We can't accept all requests, but we will consider them.\nI'm also open to reviews on the AppStore. However, it is difficult to communicate with them, so we may not be able to understand their intentions.        Q. Where do I report bugs?   Please send us your request from \"Contact\" in the app.\nSince it is difficult to communicate with AppStore reviews, it may not be possible to reproduce them and there may be a delay in response.        Q. YouTube videos are no longer playing in the app. Is this a bug?   It's most likely a bug. Please contact us from \"Contact\" in the app, including the URL of the video that is not playing.       Q. Videos from my camera roll are no longer playing in the app. Is this a bug?   Deleting a video from the camera roll will stop it from playing.\nIf you choose to save photos to iCloud, they will not be playable at a later date. Please register the video uploaded to iCloud to the application.\nIf you have videos in your camera roll but they do not play, try restarting the app/device to see if that solves the problem.     Other    Q. Can\u0026#39;t I get rid of ads through in-app purchases?   I have no plans to sell ad removal items.        Q. Do you accept Donate?   I accept from the donation link in the menu on the upper left.\nThe donations received will be used as food for living.       Q. Will you be distributing the Android app?   Distribution started on 08/06/2022.\nFor the Android version, please refer to the following website.\nhttps://hyoromo.github.io/sound-game-training-android/\n    "
